# Design Guide

# GOAL

EASILY DIGESTIBLE. EASILY DIGESTIBLE. 
EASY TO DIGEST BUT NOT OVERLY SIMPLIFIED.

## Vibes.
Warm, lean, and approachable, which means:
- Minimalistic but not sterile
- Sleek but not corporate
- Creative and fun, but not gimmicky or AI-y

I want it to be understandable and impactful for recruiters, and interesting and impressive for engineers.

The original live site -- I want this overall feel but slightly more creative and better content delivery. I want the project pages and about to be updated since it's text dense at the moment. This is the base, do not verge too too far from it. Keep things like all media (demos, pngs) and main colors. The footer and nav will remain the same as well.

I prefer the two column style for the most part, but feel free to use up the entire width if the content is designed well.

2) Card collections

Check the mockups/card-browser and its collections for ideas and references of how to break up code. 

You do NOT have to stick with just these. These are ideas, but feel free to create and ideate outside of the box, especially if none are strong for project content


## Colors
- **Background**: #0f1419 (warm dark)
- **Cards**: #232937 
- **Text**: #f0f0f0 primary, #b8c5d1 secondary
- **Accents**: #92bba1 sage green, #66a5da blue, (some orange as third accent)

## Things to keep in mind
- No large numbers as hero elements (feels corporate and gimmicky/fronty/tech bro-y)
- No emojis: feels cheap
- No em dashes in content. Content needs to remain same, unless slightly updated to fit better visuals (e.g. if card design is used)
- No dense text walls: hard to read, people will skim
- No flashy animations: feels gimmicky and AI
- Avoid cold, sterile tech vibes or bro tech-y: feels fake and like I'm fronting instead of genuine
- No gradients: gives AI
- Be tasteful with hovers: can be powerful, but too much is weak.
- No basic cheap cards with left/top border. Beyond overused.

===============

Here are some examples:

# What I Dislike
Corporate/Business Card Aesthetics:
- Big numbers as hero elements (95%, 100%, 70%)
- "Insurance policy" or "vault security" metaphors
- Stat showcases with percentages and performance metrics
- Speedometer/gauge visualizations

Flashy/Gimmicky Elements:
- Ripple effects and cascade animations
- Overly visual metaphors (vault doors, locks, etc.)
- Status badges and "in progress" indicators
- Marketing-heavy language ("Transform your workflow!", "100% SAFE")

Generic Tech Content:
- Basic tech stack grids (React, Node.js, MongoDB lists)
- Generic process flows with numbered steps
- Split-screen comparison layouts with percentages
- Workflow cards with completion statuses

# Overall Vibe I Avoid:
- Feels too "corporate dashboard" or "SaaS landing page"
- Tries too hard to impress with numbers/metrics
- Generic startup/tech company aesthetics
- Marketing-forward rather than craft-focused

# My Sweet Spot
I prefer cards that feel more like thoughtful design tools than corporate dashboards - functional, warm, and focused on the actual creative process rather than selling the benefits.

This matches my design guide perfectly: avoiding "corporate feels" and "large numbers as hero elements" while favoring genuine, craft-focused presentations.
